Hi, I’m Mason. I’m a computer scientist / mechanical engineer with an interest in problems at the intersction to the digital and physical worlds.  This interest brought me to Stanford where I completed my B.S. in Computer Science and my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering.  During my time at Stanford I studied **optimal control**, **system identification**, **artificial intelligence**, and gained hands-on experience in **manufacturing** through my time as a CA in Stanford's [Product Realization Lab](https://productrealization.stanford.edu/).  I have been lucky enough to be able to apply these experiences to problems in **robotics**, **vehicle dynamics**, and even road racing (by way of the [24 Hours of LeMons](https://24hoursoflemons.com/)).
